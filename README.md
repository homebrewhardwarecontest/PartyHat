# PartyHat
Code for the PartyHat hard hat

This code needs to be commented. It's not the best code in the world, but it works.

You'll need to download the Arduino IDE

You'll need to add the NODE MCU to the board manager, and the ESP8266 library:
  https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/readme.html
   
You'll need to install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library (It's in the library manager in the Arduino IDE):
  https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/liquid-crystal-i2-c

  
You don't really need the .html file, you need the .h file.  I just included it because reasons.
Have fun!
